## HTML requirements:

Must use the following tags: Links, Divs, Paragraphs, and Images.
⋅⋅* I used divs to structure my site based on its two major components: typing text and resume button. I used href links for each of my respective professional sites that, on click, would direct to them in a new page. I used a paragraph to distinguish between my name and the typing text below it. Finally, I used images to represent each site logo that I linked (ie. LinkedIn, GitHub)

Set the title of the page and add meta tags for SEO.
⋅⋅* I set the title of the page to "Rachit Kataria" and added several meta tags such as description, keywords, and robots for web crawlers.

## CSS requirements:
Must not use “inline style” but link to a separate style sheet.
⋅⋅* I linked to a styles.css with all of my styling content.
Must change the following properties: border-radius, background-color, padding.
⋅⋅* I used a border radius, background color, and padding to give my resume href the impression of a button.
Must change the font to something from google-fonts.
⋅⋅* I used Raleway and Lato from Google Fonts.
Must have at least one key-frame animation on “hover.”
⋅⋅* I used the CSS transform animation on hover for both my site logos and resume href.

## Bootstrap Requirements:
Must use Bootstrap grid system to have multiple columns (for responsive design).
Must use at least one Bootstrap component.
⋅⋅* For this portion of the assignment, I used Flexbox and stylized hrefs to create responsive design. I will implement this in bootstrap in a later iteration of my project.
